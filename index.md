# Hagbard Celine

Karl Werner Lothar Koch (July 22, 1965 â€“ c. May 23, 1989) was a German hacker in the 1980s, 
who called himself "hagbard", after Hagbard Celine.
He was involved in a Cold War computer espionage incident.

Koch was born in Hanover. He was heavily influenced by The Illuminatus! Trilogy by Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea.
Besides adopting his pseudonym from a character in the book, he also named his computer "FUCKUP" ("First Universal Cybernetic-Kinetic Ultra-Micro Programmer"),
after a computer designed and built by that character.
